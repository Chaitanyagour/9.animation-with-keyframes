## 👋 About Me

Hello! I'm **Chaitanya Sharma**, a passionate learner currently diving deep into **Web Development**.  
I've just completed my journey of learning **HTML and CSS**, and I'm now moving towards **JavaScript**.  
But before that, I will build some creative HTML + CSS projects, possibly enhanced using **AI**.

> 🎯 My future goal is to become a **Cybersecurity Expert**, with strong knowledge of **Artificial Intelligence** and **Blockchain**.

## 💻 Project Overview

This project features a fully animated image using **CSS-only** techniques.  
The image follows a complex motion path (rotations + translations + scaling) based on a creative animation concept I designed.

### 🎥 Animation Path:
- Starts from the center
- Moves to **bottom-left**, then **top-left**
- Travels to **top-right**, then **bottom-right**
- Returns to the **center**
- Shrinks left-right using **scaleX()**
- Comes back to normal

## 🧠 What I’ve Learned in HTML & CSS

### ✅ HTML:
- Basic Tags (`<div>`, `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, `<img>`, `<button>`)
- Page structure and semantic layout
- Linking CSS to HTML

### ✅ CSS:
- **Reset styling** using `* { ... }`
- Working with **classes and IDs**
- **Flexbox & Float** based layouts
- **Text styling** (fonts, color, weight)
- **Box model**: margin, padding, border
- **Responsive units** (`vh`, `%`, `vw`)
- **Hover effects**
- **Animations and keyframes**:
  - `@keyframes`
  - `transform: translate(), rotate(), scale()`
  - `animation`, `transition`, `ease-in-out`
